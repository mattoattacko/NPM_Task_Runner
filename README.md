# Dice Simulator 9000

![Dice Simulator](img/npm-taskrunner.png)

## Description:
 Here we are using npm and uglify-js to create task runners to take our code and consolidate it into the build folder. 


#### Requirements:
 Uglify-js & Mocha are required dependencies. Use <$npm install> to add them to your local machine once you have downloaded this project. 

 Use the index.html located in the build/ folder (not the one in the src/ folder) to view the actual dice simulator.
